        The Fitness Test you are about to take is the Progressive Aerobic
        Cardiovascular Endurance Run, also called the PACER test. The PACER test
        is a multistage aerobic capacity test that gets more difficult as it
        continues. The running speed starts out slow, but every minute, you must
        run faster. Line up at the start line. When you hear the signal, run
        across the 20-meter distance before the beep. At the sound of the beep,
        turn around and run back to the starting line. The second time you hear
        the sound, you must run again, making sure to reach the line before the
        next beep. Continue running in this way until you can no longer keep up
        with the pace. Remember, the test will begin slowly, but after about one
        minute, the beeps will get closer together. Each level you complete will
        be announced, so you will know how far youâ€™ve gone. Get ready to start.
        The test will begin with the first beep. Run as long as you can. Ready?
        Go.
